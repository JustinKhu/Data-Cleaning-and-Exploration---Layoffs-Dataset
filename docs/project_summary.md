# Layoffs Data Cleaning & Exploratory Analysis Project

## Project Context
This project analyzes a global dataset of company layoffs from 2020 to 2024.  
The dataset includes information such as company name, location, industry, funding stage, total layoffs, and percentage of workforce affected.

The objective was to clean and standardize the dataset using MySQL, identify major layoff trends, and visualize my findings in Excel.  
This analysis helps uncover how different industries, companies, and countries reacted to changes in the economy both before and after the pandemic.
